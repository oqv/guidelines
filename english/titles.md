# Title Guide

We follow [The Associated Press Stylebook](http://www.apstylebook.com/)


## Title Case

1. Capitalize the first and last words of the title.
2. Capitalize all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs,
and subordinating conjunctions (e.g. `as`, `because`, `although`, `if`).
3. Capitalize the principal words, including prepositions and conjunctions
of **four or more letters**.
4. Capitalize an article--`the`, `a`, `an`--or words of fewer than
four letters if it is the first or last word in a title.
5. Lowercase the `to` in an infinitive.
