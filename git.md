## Commit Messages

The first line of a commit should be 50 characters or less. This is a soft limit, so that git's command line output is more readable. Use this line as a clear summary of the change. Try using imperative language in this line. A good commit message is "Add reactive variable for CPU clock speed". Worse examples include "cpu clock speed" or "Added Meteor.CPU_speed so that we can avoid a setTimeout in the main example."
Subsequent lines (if any) can be fairly verbose and detailed. Use your judgement.
